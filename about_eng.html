it seems Cold Electricity has more meanings to diffrent people. BEDINI

since Radiant energy is confusig to some extent) has nothing to do with
the terminology used in conventional science (as described in

electricity is often observed as a cooling phenomenon at an electric
spark. It is related to the utilization of the Potential Energy of
atomic and subatomic magnetic dipoles. Until a strong magnetic field
can overcome the forces of random thermal motion, alignment will not
form between magnetic-dipoles to utilize this potential energy of
magnetic dipoles. A slow charge and VERY SHORT DISCHARGE less than one
microsecond (&lt; 1 &#956;s) - high voltage spark is required to make a
magnetic field strong enough to cause this alignment. Potential Energy
is restored by absorption of infrared photons AMBIENT HEATH ABSORPTION,

Cold electricity presents a form of electric energy without electron
flow, i.e. zero current. It was shown to us by Dr. Tesla over 100 years
ago. Tesla experimented with violently abrupt DC electrical discharges
and discovered a new force in the process. Only after conducting
exhaustive experimental trials for three years, Tesla announced this
stupendous discovery in a paper published in December, 1892, entitled
"The Dissipation of Electricity". Incredibly, most academicians of the
day completely missed the mark in understanding the true significance
of his paper.<br>
<br>
The radiant electricity inflow is manifested as NEGATIVE resistance. We
can measure resistance, but True Cold electricity does not show up on
our meters, because there is no electron flow, yet it can burn a
filament bulb on only one wire! There is no need for two wires!<br>
<br>
In conventional electricity, the dragging electrons, create the magnetic field and, these two go hand in hand.<br>
The magnetic fields are caused by the dragging electrons, which in turn
are a secondary effect of this primary True Cold Electricity flow.<br>
You can't tap something secondary without the primary part that caused it...<br>
<br>
Very few non-conventional scientists, engineers and inventors
understand Radiant Cold Electricity phenomena. But the most part of
conventional academia still thinks: electricity energy is only related
electron flow. Radiant Electricity has NOTHING to do with DC or AC
current.<br>
First electricity was Direct Current, DC.<br>
Second electricity was Alternating Current, AC.<br>
Third electricity is counter-intuitive Radiant Cold Electricity. It is strange, magic, healthy and IT WORKS!<br>
<br>
--- ---<br>
<br>
Cold electricity is a negative time flow of electrons while hot
electricity is a forward time flow of electrons. Until people recognize
time as being a factor and stop considering it as a measurement only,
this will never be understood.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Without time, energy can not be released or converted from one form to
another. An aether unit is composed of forward and negative time. This
is where the electrons gets it's energy in order to maintain it's own
magnetic field.<br>
Cold electricity does register on our instruments as Back-EMF since it is flowing in negative time or flowing backwards.<br>
There is a difference between Back-EMF and cold electricity, but we will see cold electricity on our instruments as BEMF.<br>
<hr class="style-four" style="border: 0px none ; height: 12px;">So it seems Cold Electricity has more meanings to different people.<br>
Same thing happens with Bemf or Back Emf.<br>
Some people say the Bemf is simply the spike which is seen coming from
a coil when power is switched off, and others believe Bemf happens
whenever the field strength increases or decreases...<br>
<br>
It has been shown to us by Mr.Tesla that his form of Cold Electricity is what is called a massless current.<br>
This means without electron movement since electrons seem to have mass.<br>
Because or this it can go faster, much faster, far beyond light-speed.<br>
However,backwards is a different thing.<br>
There are several people who have replicated some of Tesla's work and
they all agree the electrons get "choked" inside the coils along the
way, and thus only real massless current can pass.<br>
This behaves different then conventional electricity because it will
seek it's way along dielectric paths ignoring short circuits.<br>
There are several setups which show these behaviours.<br>
For example if you read Mr. Eric P. Dollard's book "Condensed intro
into Tesla Transformers, you will find setups that produce this form of
electricity.<br>
Take a close look at figure 4 which is the balanced coil system.<br>
It encounters segments of coils which have a direct relationship to the total wavelength of all coils together.<br>
I won't go into detail, just read the literature and do the tests if you want to find out the real nature of the beast.<br>
<hr class="style-four" style="border: 0px none ; height: 12px;">---When
a bulb is lit with cold electricity, is it lit because of the wire or
the parameters of the space around the wire? If just a wire then a
filament should glow outside of the bulb.<br>
If reverse time has anything to do with it, then how can we experience it in forward time?<br>
--- End quote ---<br>
We experience it in forward time as BEMF that runs cool and not hot.<br>
<br>
"Research into the works of Nikola Tesla reveals electric phenomena
that behave contrary to the theory of electricity in present use.
Explanation of Tesla's inventions has been given from the standpoint of
physics, yielding many misconceptions. The science of physics is based
on the phenomena surrounding particles and mass, which finds little
application in the study of electric phenomena.<br>
The explanation of Tesla's discoveries are to be found in the science
of electricity rather than the science of physics. The sci­ence of
electricity has been dormant since the days (1900) of Stein­metz, Tesla
and Heaviside. " Eric Dollard<br>
<hr class="style-four" style="border: 0px none ; height: 12px;">John Bedini said to Oxford University mathematical physicist Dr Dave Clements, when he has asked him:<br>
<br>
What is Radiant energy?<br>
<br>
"Radiant energy, to me, what do I consider radiant, OK, what I consider
radiant is the capturing of a spike, I consider that radiant. anything
that, say, I generate, the radiant energy.<br>
I do that by my coils, my switching circuits. That's how I generate
radiant energy. I'm only concerned with a sharp transient, in the
spike, as far as the radiant goes. As far as the negative energy goes,
the negative energy comes from the battery. Once I generate this sharp
transient, and charge the battery, it's a negative effect to the
battery, because there's no heat in the battery.<br>
"It seems to be like an ocean wave, or a gravitational wave. It seems
to ride in on a some form of gravity wave. where it's up and down, up
and down, sometimes it comes in stronger and sometimes a lot lighter.<br>
It does change, this wave does change, during say a full moon, some of
these motors have been known, during the full moon, to speed up just a
little bit, and go a little bit faster in the night and a little bit
slower during the day."<br>
<hr class="style-four" style="border: 0px none ; height: 12px;">Edwin
Gray, Sr rediscovered the technique of capturing electric energy
directly from the environment in the late 1950's. Mr. Gray discovered
that the instantaneous discharge of a high voltage capacitor could be
shocked into releasing a huge, radiant energy inflow, manifested as
electrostatic burst. This radiant energy spike was triggered and
captured by special device Mr. Gray called "conversion element
switching tube."<br>

Quote from: -[marco]- on April 30, 2009, 10:14:01 AM ---Cold electricity is TRUE electricity.<br>
It is the real power without electron flow.<br>
This type of electricity was shown to us by Mr.Tesla over 100 years ago.<br>
The electrons are simply "dragged" by this Cold electricity flow and this creates what we see as resistance.<br>
And this is also the reason why conventional electricity shows up on our meters.<br>
We can measure resistance, but True Cold electricity does not show up
on our meters, because there is no electron flow, yet it can burn a
filament bulb on one wire.<br>
In conventional electricity, the dragging electrons, create the magnetic field and, these two go hand in hand.<br>
This is the reason why we won't find any OU in magnetics.<br>
The magnetic fields are caused by the dragging electrons, which in turn
are a secondary effect of this primary True Cold Electricity flow.<br>
You can't tap something secondary without the primary part that caused it...<br>
For some people, all this is well understood, but for the most part,
people are still thinking electricity is electron flow and even our
teachers tell us it is.<br>

--- End quote ---<br>
You first say that cold electricity drags the electrons, then you say
at the end, electricity is not electron flow. You also said true cold
electricity is without electron flow and it can burn a filament bulb on
one wire. Doesn't the wire that is being burned from the cold
electricity have free electrons in it, that would be dragged by this
cold electricity in order to cause the bulb to light? Replace those
filament wires with a wire that doesn't have free electrons and see if
the bulb lights with either cold electricity or "true cold
electricity", since according to you, electricity isn't electron flow.<br>
Cold electricity is a negative time flow of electrons while hot
electricity is a forward time flow of electrons. Until people recognize
time as being a factor and stop considering it as a measurement only,
this will never be understood.<br>
Without time, energy can not be released or converted from one form to

Cold electricity does register on our instruments as BEMF since it is
